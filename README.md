  Hii Guys, this is my first project in <b>Machine Learning</b>. I've done this entire project by refering Google and YouTube in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index">Google colab</a>. The file is being attached to this repository.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I've downloaded the dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/avikasliwal/used-cars-price-prediction">kaggale website</a>. I'm just a newbie to this, but have worked with;<b><li>RandomForest.</li><XGBoost.</li><li>DecisionTree.</li></b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  In this project I've trained the model with available dataset, I hope the output would be more precise when loaded with more number of data. There won't trouble of overfitting or not loading as RandomForest has been used. Also, the project been deployed will show us whether it is successful.
  <p>
    
<h1 align="center">THANK YOU</h1>
