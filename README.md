  Hello readers, this is a project in <b>Machine Learning</b>. I've done this entire project by refering Google, YouTube and got guided by my kind mentor. This was developed in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index">Google colab</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p style="font-family:Arial">
  Data  from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/avikasliwal/used-cars-price-prediction">kaggale website</a>. The algorithms I've worked with are;<b><li>RandomForest.</li><li>XGBoost.</li><li>DecisionTree.</li></b>
  </p>
  
  <p style="font-family:Arial">
  In this project I've trained the model with available dataset, I hope the output would be more precise when loaded with more number of data. There won't trouble of overfitting or not loading as RandomForest has been used. Also, the project been deployed will show us whether it is successful.
  <p>
